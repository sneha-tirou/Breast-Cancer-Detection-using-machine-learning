Breast cancer detection using machine learning


Predicting breast cancer using Machine learning model using python . Here, We use various machine learning models like stochastic gradient descent , linear regression, decision tree,naive bayes, k nearest neighbor and random forest. we find the prediction accuracy of each model and find the best model. 

with the best model we use streamlit to deploy the Ml model and create a webpage for taking in input from the user and to predict the result.
